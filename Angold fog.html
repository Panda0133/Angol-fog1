       Hi im writing this letter to you because: 
        I really, really want to help at your cool music festival! I love music so much, and I think it would be super fun to be a part of making the festival awesome.
        
        I've helped at other music events before, like making sure people are safe and helping the singers and bands. Plus, when I was at school, I learned about planning events, so I know a bit about that too.
        
        What I'm most excited about is being on a team and working with others to make the festival a big, happy party. I promise to work super hard and make it a great time for everyone who comes.
        
        Please let me know how I can help! You can reach me at [Email Address] or [Phone Number]. Thanks a bunch!
        
        Sincerely,
        
       Szirmai Andor</p>
